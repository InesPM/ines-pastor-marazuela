abstract: We present a complete dynamical study of the intermediate polar and
  dwarf nova cataclysmic variable GK Per (Nova Persei 1901) based on a
  multi-site optical spectroscopy and ������-band photometry campaign. The
  radial velocity curve of the evolved donor star has a semi-amplitude ������2 =
  126.4 ± 0.9 km s−1 and an orbital period ������ = 1.996872 ± 0.000009 d. We
  reﬁne the projected rotational velocity of the donor star to ������rot sin
  ������ = 52 ± 2 km s−1 which, together with ������2, provides a donor star to
  white dwarf mass ratio ������ = ������2/������1 = 0.38 ± 0.03. We also
  determine the orbital inclination of the system by modelling the phase-folded
  ellipsoidal light curve and obtain ������ = 67◦ ± 5◦. The resulting dynamical
  masses are ������1 = 1.03+−00..1161 M and ������2 = 0.39+−00..0076 M at 68 per
  cent conﬁdence level. The white dwarf dynamical mass is compared with
  estimates obtained by modelling the decline light curve of the 1901 nova event
  and X-ray spectroscopy. The best matching mass estimates come from the nova
  light curve models and the X-ray data analysis by Wada et al. (2018) that use
  the ratio between the Alfvén radius in quiescence and during dwarf nova
  outburst.
