abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients1
  whose brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic yet compact
  enough to produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far
  been detected at frequencies from 8 gigahertz (ref. 2) down to 300 megahertz
  (ref. 3), but lower-frequency emission has remained elusive. Some FRBs
  repeat4–6, and one of the most frequently detected, FRB 20180916B7, has a
  periodicity cycle of 16.35 days (ref. 8). Using simultaneous radio data
  spanning a wide range of wavelengths (a factor of more than 10), here we show
  that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 megahertz, and that its activity window
  is frequency dependent (that is, chromatic). The window is both narrower and
  earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind interaction models predict a wider
  window at higher frequencies, the opposite of our observations. Our full-cycle
  coverage shows that the 16.3-day periodicity is not aliased. We establish that
  low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For bursts of the same
  fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 megahertz than at
  1.4 gigahertz. Combining our results with previous upper limits on the all-sky
  FRB rate at 150 megahertz, we find there are 3–450 FRBs in the sky per day
  above 50 Jy ms. Our chromatic results strongly disfavour scenarios in which
  absorption from strong stellar winds causes FRB periodicity. We demonstrate
  that some FRBs are found in ‘clean’ environments that do not absorb or scatter
  low-frequency radiation.
