abstract: 2I/Borisov is the first interstellar comet we know to have visited the Solar System, and the second interstellar visitor after ‘Oumuamua. Initial observations with the William Herschel Telescope and Gemini North Telescope reveal cometary features indistinguishable from Solar System comets, apart from its hyperbolic orbit.
