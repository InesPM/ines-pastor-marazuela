abstract: We present a complete dynamical study of the intermediate polar and
  dwarf nova cataclysmic variable GK Per (Nova Persei 1901) based on a
  multi-site optical spectroscopy and R-band photometry campaign. The radial
  velocity curve of the evolved donor star has a semi-amplitude K2 = 126.4 ± 0.9
  km s−1 and an orbital period P = 1.996872 ± 0.000009 d. We reﬁne the projected
  rotational velocity of the donor star to v_rot sin i = 52 ± 2 km s−1 which,
  together with K2, provides a donor star to white dwarf mass ratio q = M2/M1 =
  0.38 ± 0.03. We also determine the orbital inclination of the system by
  modelling the phase-folded ellipsoidal light curve and obtain i = 67◦ ± 5◦.
  The resulting dynamical masses are M1 = 1.03+−00..1161 M and M2 =
  0.39+−00..0076 M at 68 per cent conﬁdence level. The white dwarf dynamical
  mass is compared with estimates obtained by modelling the decline light curve
  of the 1901 nova event and X-ray spectroscopy. The best matching mass
  estimates come from the nova light curve models and the X-ray data analysis by
  Wada et al. (2018) that use the ratio between the Alfvén radius in quiescence
  and during dwarf nova outburst.
