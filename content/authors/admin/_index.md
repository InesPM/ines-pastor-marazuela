I am a final year PhD student in astrophysics at the Anton Pannekoek Institute (University of Amsterdam), working on fast radio burst searches with the Apertif radio telescope. I completed my Master at the Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France) in 2018, and I am originally from Segovia, Spain.
