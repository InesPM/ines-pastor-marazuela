Hello! I'm Ines, a Rubicon Research Fellow in astrophysics at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (University of Manchester, UK). I study Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a mysterious type of astrophysical transient that comes from very distant galaxies, only last a few milliseconds, and we only see in radio waves. To look for these FRBs, I used the Apertif radio telescope in the Netherlands during my PhD, and now I'm using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa. I finished my PhD in November 2022, and before that I completed my Master's degree at the Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France) in 2018. I was born and raised in the beautiful town of Segovia, in Spain.
