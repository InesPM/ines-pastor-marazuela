Hello! I’m Inés, a postdoctoral researcher at ASTRON in the Netherlands. My research centers on radio transients, specifically Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), which are enigmatic astrophysical phenomena originating from distant galaxies, lasting only a few milliseconds, and detectable solely in radio waves. During my PhD, I used the Apertif radio telescope in the Netherlands, and the MeerKAT radio telescope (South Africa) as a Rubicon fellow at the University of Manchester, UK. Currently, as part of the Astroflash team, I continue my search for radio transients using LOFAR. I completed my PhD in November 2022 and earned my Master’s degree from the Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France, in 2018. I grew up in the beautiful town of Segovia, Spain. Welcome to my website!
